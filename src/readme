# --------------- PUT A SMALL DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM!! ------------------ 
# To change the values of the parameters just erase the previous values,
#without adding spaces or other simbols.
#
# The dimension has to be an integer.
#
# The size must be an odd number, so that the lattice is symmetrical with
#respect to the origin.
#
# Coin_type is the type of the coin used, fermion or boson. The type must be
#given for every dimension, separated by spaces. At the moment only fermion is
#supported.
#
# Thetas are the angles that specifies the coin operator. Must be given in 
#DEGREES for every dimension and separated by spaces.
#
# The coin_initial state is specified by givin the pair of angles in the bloch 
#sphere for every dimension, also separated by spaces, in the form: 
#   theta/2 phi.
